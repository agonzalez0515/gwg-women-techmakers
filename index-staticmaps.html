Note: Google Static Maps marely require an image div and the placement of the url within that image div will embed the map.
The code below assumes that latitude and longitude are received as parameters; along with zoom and size (can be variablized)
and the url that is then constructed can be used to both embed the map in the correct div but also to generate and cache the
map using Cache url outside of the Service Worker
